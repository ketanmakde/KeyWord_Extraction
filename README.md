# KeyWord_Extraction
Keywords extractions from Starbucks coffee reviews.

- Different NLP techniques were used to extract keywords from Starbucks coffee reviews.

- We utilized Yet Another Keyword Extractor (YAKE), KeyBERT, and a TF-IDF-based approach to extract the top 5 keywords from the reviews.

- Using the Huggingface library, we extracted the emotions behind each review. It was observed that most of the reviews fell under the categories of anger and joy.

- With the help of WordCloud, the top words for each emotion were visualized. This method was implemented for the keywords extracted using YAKE, KeyBERT, and TF-IDF models.
